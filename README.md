# AAS_Tools
This is the documentation of the referenced tools used in Asset Administration Shell Tool Comparison: A Case Study with Real Digital Twins Used in Petrochemical Industry.

GitHub repositories of open source implementations can be found below:
FA³ST Service: https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/FAAAST-Service
Eclipse BaSyx™ : https://github.com/eclipse-basyx
Eclipse AASX Server : https://github.com/eclipse-aaspe/server
NOVA Asset Administration Shell : https://gitlab.com/novaas/catalog/nova-school-of-science-and-technology/novaas

Docker compose files can be achieved from the repositories. 
Additionally, our AASX is created with AASX Package Explorer (v2024-06-10.alpha). File can be tested with 3 open sources which are Eclipse BaSyx™, Eclipse AASX Server and FA³ST Service.
AASX Package Explorer (v2024-06-10.alpha) supports only V3, so created AASX file is not compatible with NOVAAS. For testing NOVAAS, an example AASX file can be created with Metamodel V2 using aasx-package-explorer.2022-05-10.
